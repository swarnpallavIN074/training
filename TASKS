1. Create a simple Web Page having 2 pages
Page 1 will have a link which will take us to page 2
Page 2 will have a button which should open a dialogue box. When clicked on browser back button it should close the dialogue box instead of taking me to previous page i.e. page 1


2. The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down
Input :  m = 2, n = 2;
Output : 2
There are two paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)

Input :  m = 2, n = 3;
Output : 3
There are three paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)

3. Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.
